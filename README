HTML5 Element Hierarchy:

When designing a layout for the app, use this hierarchy for quick and easy styling:

HTML
	HEAD
	BODY
		HEADER
		ARTICLE (main content goes here)
		FOOTER
		

Within pages, the following HTML5 elements are used for pages composed of columns, which in turn are composed of blocks.

SECTION (individual column)
	DIV.block (single block for content)
		HGROUP
			H1
			H2


The blog also uses this hierarchy:

SECTION (one blog post)
	HGROUP
		H1
		H2
	P (blog content)
