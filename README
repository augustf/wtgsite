Prerequisites: Imagemagick, rmagick, Authlogic, ckeditor, MySQL, Rails 3

Installation:
Clone from git repository
Copy config/database.yml.sample to config/database.yml and complete it
Run "bundle install"
Run "rake db:migrate"

NB: Under Rails 3, the default authlogic gem doesn't work, and this branch (git://github.com/odorcicd/authlogic.git rails3 branch) must be used. This is already provided for in the Gemfile. See http://www.stjhimy.com/posts/6 for details
